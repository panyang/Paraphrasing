%%:There have now been 153 confirmed cases in 18 states of a respiratory illness that has sent scores of children to emergency rooms and , in some cases , even to intensive care units .
%%:Enterovirus 68 got its number based on the order in which it was discovered .
%%:The first cases were identified in California in 1962 in four children who had bronchitis and pneumonia .
%%:Since it was discovered , and through 2005 , there were only 26 confirmed reports of the virus to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
%%:It is possible that the respiratory symptoms are more acute among children than adults .
%%:Other than treating the symptoms of patients who have contracted the virus , there is very little that can be done to stop the spread of EV-D68 .

%%:Of the three children who had symptoms of flaccid paralysis at Children 's Mercy , Jackson said , none tested positive for EV-D68 .
%%:The spread of D68 may have been masked .
%%:EV-D68 infection was also associated with 11 of 14 cases reported in Chicago .
%%:In other words , these viral outbreaks tend to persist at a low level -- often asymptomatically -- in a certain segment of the population , and reemerge due to unknown factors .
%%:EV-D68 can cause mild to severe respiratory illness .
%%:In the United States , people are more likely to get infected with enteroviruses in the summer and fall .
%%:Watch CDC medical epidemiologist Brian Rha explain who is at risk for EV-D68 and more in a 2-minute video on WebMD .
%%:EV-D68 can only be diagnosed by doing specific lab tests on specimens from a person 's nose and throat , or blood .
%%:However , most can not do specific testing to determine the type of enterovirus , like EV-D68 .
%%:CDC and some state health departments can do this sort of testing .
%%:CDC recommends that clinicians only consider EV-D68 testing for patients with severe respiratory illness and when the cause is unclear .
%%:For more information , see Enterovirus D68 for Health Care Professionals .
%%:Some people with severe respiratory illness may need to be hospitalized .
%%:There are no antiviral medications currently available for people who become infected with EV-D68 .
%%:Avoid touching eyes , nose and mouth with unwashed hands .
%%:Avoid close contact such as kissing , hugging , and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick .
%%:Also , see an infographic that shows these prevention steps .
%%:There are no vaccines for preventing EV-D68 infections .
%%:What 's unusual at the moment is the high number of hospitalizations .
%%:An analysis by the CDC showed at least 30 of the Kansas City children tested positive for EV-D68 , Missouri health officials said .
%%:Respiratory problems appear to the hallmark of EV-D68 , according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services .
%%:Some cases could , in theory , contribute to death , but none of the Missouri cases have resulted in death and no data are available for overall morbidity and mortality from the virus in the United States , the agency said .
%%:Like other enteroviruses , the respiratory illness appears to spread through close contact with infected people .
%%:Clean and disinfect surfaces that are regularly touched by different people , such as toys and doorknobs .
%%:Avoid shaking hands , kissing , hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick .
%%:Enterovirus D68 is now reported to be responsible for 11 deaths , mostly small children .
%%:In 2014 two killer viruses have been reported in the U.S. news .
%%:Respiratory symptoms occur when the virus infects the lungs and airways .
%%:If the virus is able to move into other tissues in the body such as nerves , then the infection can attack nerve cells in the spine that control movement .
%%:This exact scenario happened in 2012 when researchers at Stanford University reported 25 childhood cases of paralysis of an unknown cause that shared features with polio , and in some cases also started as a respiratory illness .
%%:Intracellular mycoplasma infections consist of small , very tiny , pleomorphic bacteria which do n't have a cell wall .
%%:Chronic fatigue syndrome : 50 % to 60 % or more of cases have this infection .
%%:Autism spectrum disorders : 58 % to 65 % have mycoplasmas .
%%:These diseases do not appear to have a single cause and have multiple symptoms .

%%:• Typically , enteroviruses have circulated with summer-fall seasonality in temperate climates .
%%:• It is likely that testing for and reporting of EV-D68 cases have occurred among the most severe cases or outbreaks , resulting in detection bias of the observed severity of illness .
%%:Disinfect frequently touched surfaces , such as toys and doorknobs , especially if someone is sick .
%%:The detection of EV-D68 in nasopharyngeal specimens of some affected children raises the question of a possible link between EV-D68 infections and severe neurological disease .
